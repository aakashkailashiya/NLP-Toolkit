A small collection of Natural Language Processing utilities and example pipelines. This repository contains tools, scripts, and example notebooks for common NLP tasks such as tokenization, text classification, named entity recognition (NER), embedding generation, and simple data processing utilities.

> NOTE: This README is a draft created locally. To publish it to GitHub you'll need to clone the remote repository (if you haven't), add this file, commit, and push from a machine with access to the repo.

## Contents

- tools/ — reusable scripts and utilities
- notebooks/ — example Jupyter notebooks demonstrating usage
- examples/ — small end-to-end examples and demo data
- docs/ — optional documentation or design notes

(If any of the above folders do not exist in the repo, update this README after inspection.)

## Quick features

- Tokenizers (basic whitespace, simple rule-based)
- Small pre-processing utilities (lowercasing, stopword removal)
- Example classifier training scripts
- Utilities to load & use pre-trained embeddings

## Installation

Option A: Install from PyPI (if published)

```bash
pip install nlp-toolkit
```

Option B: Install from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aakashkailashiya/NLP-Toolkit.git
cd NLP-Toolkit
pip install -r requirements.txt  # if present
python -m pip install -e .        # optional editable install if setup.py/pyproject exists
```

## Usage

Examples (adjust paths to match repo layout):

```python
from toolkit.tokenize import simple_tokenize
print(simple_tokenize("Hello world!"))
```

See `notebooks/` for runnable examples and `examples/` for small demo scripts.
